/*  All the matrices/tensors are stored in the row major format.

   NOTES for the conv layers.
-> The conv1d & conv1d_lr layers work for all cases and can be used unconstrained. 
   There are no hard constraints for the parallel version, but a few points regarding its optimal usage are given below.
-> Dilation = 1 (no dilation) for all cases.
-> For the non-depthwise cases, store the matrices as described below. Permutation might be necessary.
-> The low-rank decomposition cannot be applied to the depthwise weight matrices. This is due to the out_channels/in_channels = 0 constarint imposed by the depthwise convolution.
   For full-rank this is satisfied since out_channels = in_channels.
   But, when the matrix is decomposed, the constarint is violated (since rank < out_channels ; rank is not divisible by in_channels).
   Hence due to the decomposition being theoretically impossible, we have not provided the support.
   However we suggest a less-efficient alternative => First pre-compute the weights W = W2 * W1 and then use a regular conv.
-> For the parallel cases, the non-overlapping cases of the convolution are computed parallelly using MatMul (since the blocked MatMul is faster).
   This howver is only valid for when the filter is fully in the input. There would be no-overlapping for the edge cases.
   Hence the MatVec code(regular code) is used to calculate these cases.

   Important points regarding parallel versions.
-> Due to the above reason, the parallel layers is only recommended for large in_time inputs.
   This should typically be for in_time (without the padding) > 2 * num_steps_one_row + stride. Else there would not be enough time-steps to efficiently parallelise.
   We need at least 2 rows for a good a MatMul performace. In the worst case the starting time step would be (stride - 1). Hence we choose 2 * num_steps_one_row + stride as the threshold.
   For the short input cases, the code will skip the MatMul computation and use MatVec instead (but the MatMul-variable computation overhead would remain).
   For such cases, the MatVec code (conv1d and conv1d_lr) would work more efficiently due to the lower RAM usage and lack of any major overheads.
-> There is no support for depthwise for conv1d_parallel.
   The regular convolution acts on all the channels while the depthwise acts only on one channel at a time.
   This results in a non-contiguos memory access. MatMul would need to process multiple such time-steps, while the MatVec would only need to process one.
   Hence, the MatVec would be able to enter the next channel earlier and would work much faster.
   While the MatMul would have cache misses (when dealing with the small chache size of edge devices).
